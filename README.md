# PLC
A collection of PLC Projects


I would like to showcase my skills in PLC by placing projects that were assigned to me in previous courses and the solutions to 
those projects.

Each project description should come in the form of a .PDF which should explain what I must program and how to test the program.
The project solution should be in .RSS file.

Thank you!
